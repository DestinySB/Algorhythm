How to Compile and Run the code.

Requirements:
  Any computer can run latest Windows, Linux, or macOS (any platform that supports Python 3.9 or above)
  Python (Tested 3.9.6 but other versions such as 3 and above may work)
  Keyboard
  Monitor
  Internet
  Terminal/Console

1.	Ensure you have Python installed. Download and install the latest version for your platform here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.	Download the Testing Python file here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestinySB/Algorhythm/refs/heads/main/testing.py
    a.	If the page opens in a new tab, right click and select “Save page as…” or similar option in your web browser. 
    b.	In the file popup, ensure the file is being saved as a .py file, and not a .txt. On Windows, this is achieved by changing the “File Type” dropdown from “Plain text” to “All files” and making sure the file name ends in .py.
3.	Install pip 
    a.	For Windows this is typically installed already check by running python –version then pip –version in Command Prompt.
    b.	For Mac open terminal and run python3 -m pip –version if it’s not installed run python3 -m ensurepip –default-pip then check again. 
4.	Install libraries
    a.	For Windows run the command line python -m pip install spotipy pandas scikit-learn numpy 
    b.	For Mac run, in terminal, python3 -m pip install spotipy pandas scikit-learn numpy
5.	Navigate to the folder where you saved the Testing Python file.
    a.	For Windows 11 users, navigate to the directory in File Explorer (usually your Downloads folder), right click in the blank space, and select “Open Terminal here”
    b.	For Mac users, open Terminal (searchable in Spotlight with Command+Space), navigate to downloads by typing cd Downloads, then press enter.
6.	Run the Python file by typing python testing.py, then press enter. It should open a web browser which is where you would login and authenticate. Right now it is invalid.
